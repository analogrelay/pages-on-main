    <h1>Pages on Main</h1>
    <p>
        GitHub Pages only supports master and gh-pages right now. Until it supports other branches,
        if you want to change your default branch to something other than master you can use the workflow
        defined in <a href="https://github.com/anurse/pages-on-main">this repository</a> to mirror commits in your default
        branch to gh-pages.
    </p>
    <p>
        Steps:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Create a gh-pages branch if there isn't one already and push it to GitHub.</li>
        <li>Commit the <a href="https://github.com/anurse/pages-on-main/blob/main/.github/workflows/copy-pages.yml">.github/workflows/copy-pages.yml</a> file from this repo to your `main` branch</li>
    </ol>
